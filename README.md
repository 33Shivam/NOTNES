INTRODUCTION

Here Lies The Daughter, Here Lies The Father, Here Lies The Sister, Here Lies The Brother, Here Lies The Wife And The Husband, And There Are Only Two Bodies Here. 

This is impossible to figure out, but it shows how intolerable life would be if people married within their own family. Everything is possible, of course, and most things have happened, but the options people have in society have to be limited in some way so that family relations and sociability remain uncomplicated. Even this is one of the reasons for the prohibition of incest in every culture on earth.

Almost every day there are reports of child rape, sexual assaults and incest and the perpetrators are rarely brought to book because of lacunae in the law. Sexual perversion is known to have been there in our society for years. Single girls and young widows not only from the upper strata of the society, as well as from the lower class are generally the victims. A large proportion of the incest cases that have been reported are non-consensual involving father-daughter relationship, where a meaningful parent-child bond turns into an intimate relationship when the father takes advantage of this attachment and start an unhealthy relationship with his daughter. And there are even cases of incest involving consenting adults and these cases are never reported because both the parties consented to it, and such a heinous crime is continuing behind the walls of a sacred institution called – family.

Like rape, adultery and other sex offences, we do not talk about incest. But that does not mean that it is non-existent. Though every third or fourth day, a case of incest is reported, still, this is the tip of the iceberg of the problem. Most of the cases go unreported since people do not want to disclose such a shameful act of any family member and they are ready to sacrifice the victim’s life for family honour and pride. And only those cases are reported which have become unbearable or if there is a serious medical problem or in any other way come to the knowledge of the public. By such ghastly acts whole social fabric of the family is destroyed. This is a very serious matter and the Legislators should think over it seriously and a strict law is required.

The word ‘incest’ was introduced in 1225 as a legal term to describe the crime of familial incest as we know it today. It means sexual relationship between persons within the prohibited degrees of relationship. Incest is a sexual activity between two persons related by close kinship which is prohibited by law or custom. The ideas of kinship, however, vary widely from community to community; hence the definition of incest also varies. The term incest can include sexual activity between family members of either gender and can include family members of any age. When one of the family members involved is a minor, incestuous activity has also been called intrafamilial child sexual abuse in many societies .

Incest means sexual relations between relatives within the prohibited degrees of relationship defined by law. The sexual relations can be between two consenting adults or minors or even can be non-consensual, whatever it may be, all forms of it are prohibited. 

In case of incest, it generally involves a minor and the most common form is father-daughter incest. And in that case, the psychological damage caused to the child is irretrievable.

In contemporary thought, incest is invariably associated with child abuse and its horrific, long-lasting, and often irreversible consequences. Incest is not such a clear-cut matter as it has been made out to be over millennia of taboo. Many participants claim to have enjoyed the act and its physical and emotional consequences. It is often the result of seduction. In some cases, two consenting and fully informed adults are involved. 
Many types of relationships, which are defined as incestuous, are between genetically unrelated parties (a stepfather and a daughter), or between fictive kin or between classificatory kin (that belong to the same matriline or patriline). Having sex with a first-degree blood relative is like having sex with oneself .

Some incest prohibitions relate to sexual acts, others to marriage. In some societies, incest is mandatory or prohibited, according to the social class. In others, the Royal House started a tradition of incestuous marriages, which was later imitated by lower classes. Some societies are more tolerant of consensual incest than others. The list is long and it serves to demonstrate the diversity of attitudes towards this most universal of taboos. Generally put, we can say that a prohibition to have sexual relations with or marry a related person should be classified as an incest prohibition. 

The prohibition of incest is often called a “universal” taboo. Indeed, virtually all cultures throughout history have condemned at least some form of intrafamilial sexual relationships or marriage. Rationales for the prohibition have been advanced by judges, legislators, anthropologists, philosophers, and legal commentators. These most prominently and typically include genetic concerns flowing from the fact that consanguineous relationships can produce deformed offspring; protection of children from sexual abuse at the hands of relatives; protection of “the family” more generally by preventing intrafamilial sexual jealousies and rivalries; and conformity with religious injunctions. 

The incest taboo is generally universal, although it is imposed differently in different societies. Usually, the closer the genetic relationship between the two, the stronger and more highly charged is the taboo prohibiting or discouraging sexual relations.

The standards of morality changes with time and place. Accordingly, prescribed degrees of incest vary among the different countries. Some include parent and child, brother and sister, uncle and niece, or aunt and nephew, and first cousins. In addition, intermarriage and sexual relations are also frequently prohibited among individuals who are related by half-blood, including brothers and sisters and uncles and nieces of the half-blood.

Some scholars maintain that the incest taboo may have been originally designed to prevent the degeneration of the genetic stock of the clan or tribe through intra-family breeding. But, even if true, this no longer applies. In today's world, it seems, therefore, that the incest taboo was and is aimed at one thing in particular: to preserve the family unit and its proper functioning.

The family is a mechanism for the allocation of genetic and material wealth. Worldly goods are passed on from one generation to the next through succession, inheritance and residence. Genetic material is handed down through the sexual act. It is the mandate of the family to increase both by accumulating property and by marrying outside the family.
Clearly, incest prevents both. It preserves a limited genetic pool and makes an increase of material possessions through intermarriage all but impossible .

In  various countries like U.K., U.S.A., Scotland, Germany, Israel, Australia etc, provisions dealing with incest have been clearly defined in their criminal statutes or their constitutions, but in India forget about a provision, incest is not even recognized as a specific offence. 

Similarly, in India also there is a need for incest provisions to prevent sexual relationship within the prohibited degrees of relationship, whether it is with consent or without consent of any of the parties.

In case when it is with consent, the law has failed to do anything as both the parties are at consent. And we are allowing this most unethical social evil to stay and grow in our society. Infact there is no recognition for such an offence in our society as if it doesn’t exist, forget about punishment.

It should also be made a punishable offence separately because of genetic reasons, as it is claimed that children born out of the incestuous unions generally have genetic defects and diseases.

And in cases where it is without the consent of one of the parties such cases are hardly reported because of family pressure and prestige. And the victim suffers in silence because of many reasons like fear, embarrassment, shame, stigma, the fear of not being typecast by society as that type who invited for it and many more such reasons. And if ever these cases are reported, they are dealt under rape laws, though rape laws are inadequate to deal with such cases.

In India, incest is not even recognized as a specific offence. There is no separate provision for incest in I.P.C. And if ever these cases are reported, they are dealt with under rape laws and all the technicalities of an offence of rape are to be followed, which is not possible in case of incest, where generally the victim is a child. I.P.C. unlike the Sexual Offences Act 1956 does not prohibit sexual intercourse within prohibited degrees of relationship and therefore it does not make any distinction between an incestuous relative and a stranger who establishes sexual liaison with either an under-aged girl or a consenting adult woman.

It should be treated as a specific offence, even though under rape laws but atleast a recognition should be given to it. Because its only after its recognition that we will be able to build a social fabric to record incest and then only we can expect incest victims to come up with their cases before the concerned authorities.

Such an abuse of relationship of trust and dependency deserves to be treated as an aggravating factor while quantifying punitive measures against the perpetrators, but it is not even recognized in our criminal justice system.
In India we not only need to draft provisions defining as to what amounts to incest and what should be the punishment for the same, but this also needs to be supported by a secure social framework for ensuring the reporting and effective legal redressal of such matters.

The present study has made an attempt to study the laws of various countries dealing with incest as compared to Indian laws on the issue and to employ a legal framework to provide for a provision dealing with incest in our criminal justice system. The study aims to delve into a comprehensive socio-legal insight of incest.


OBJECTIVES OF STUDY

The objectives for undertaking this research are as follows:
•	To compare the laws regarding incest in various countries.
•	To reflect the reasons for the failing machinery to deal with the offence of incest in India.
•	To delve in the causes of high rate of acquittals or very less punishments for such a heinous crime.
•	To broaden the scope of rape and cover within its purview a related act, incest.
•	To deal with the social factors which plays an important role in this crime.
•	To find plausible socio-legal solutions and develop a comprehensive provision dealing with incest in India and to provide for a proper redressal framework to deal with the issue.

HYPOTHESES
•	In comparison to the laws of other countries, Indian laws are inadequate to deal with the issue of incest.
•	In various cases relating to incest, it either leads to acquittals or inadequate punishments due to lacunae in our laws.
Incest forms a silent yet deeply penetrating form of sexual abuse in the most basic institution of society – The Family. Yet there is no legal provision, social structure or even a recognition for the same in our Indian laws as compared to foreign laws. An attempt needs to be made to first define, then recognise and then build social fabric to record incest. It is then only that legal mechanism can be sought to be made.


METHODOLOGY
In the present study the researcher shall adopt both the methodologies- empirical and doctrinal.

The research is empirical in nature as the researcher will conduct a survey on a few incest victims to understand the actual problems involved in such cases and how, and what law can do to help such people. Also the researcher will conduct a survey on general public, to know their viewpoint on the issue. The present research is an enquiry that attempts to study and objectively observe the instances of incest in India and how such issues are dealt with in India as compared to other countries. Method of sampling employed will be random and data will be collected on the basis of interview sessions with incest victims, general public, NGO’s, social workers in this field.

The research is doctrinal as it studies in depth the legal proposition hypothesized by way of analyzing existing laws, cases and provisions in various countries regarding incest and comparing them with Indian Laws.





INCEST: LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE IN INDIA

Meaning of incest


Incest is sexual relationship within prohibited degrees of relationship or relations by consanguinity and affinity. It is sexual relationship between persons so closely related that marriage is prohibited by law. It means sexual relationship between relatives such as father-daughter, mother-son, brother-sister, and so on. And this prohibition of sexual relationship between close relations is known as incest taboo. The relationship which are not based on blood but culturally sanctioned like god parents/ step parents, rakhi sisters and the like are also included in the definition .

Incest means sexual contact between persons who are so closely related that their marriage is illegal (e.g., parents and children, uncles/aunts and nieces/nephews, etc.). This usually takes the form of an older family member sexually abusing a child or adolescent.
Incest is considered by many experts to be a particularly damaging form of sexual abuse because it is perpetrated by individuals whom the victim trusts and depends upon. In addition, support can also be lacking and pressure to keep silent powerful as fear of the family breaking up can be overwhelming to other family members.
The word ‘incest’ is derived from the latin word ‘incestus’ which means impure. It is the most secret of all crimes, yet more common than imagined. The essential elements of the offence are  -
 

1)	The prohibited relationship of parties.
2)	The sexual acts.
3)	Knowledge of prohibited relationship.
  
Webster’s Third International Dictionary defines incest as :

“Sexual intercourse or inbreeding between closely related individuals specially when they are related or regarded as related…within degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law or custom” .             
Incest can include such Sexual acts  as:
•	Noncontact acts- sexual comments, exposure, voyeurism, showing pornographic materials, etc. 
•	Sexual contact- touching, rubbing 
•	Digital or object penetration- both of the victim and of the perpetrator 
•	Oral sex- both of the victim and of the perpetrator 
•	Penile penetration- vaginal, anal, animals 
Circumstances of the sexual acts can also be diverse including : 
•	Dyadic sexual abuse- involving two people (victim and perpetrator) 
•	Group sex 
•	Sex rings 
•	Sexual exploitation 
•	Child pornography 
•	Child prostitution 

Causes of Incest
The main causes  of incest are –

1.	Alcohol is the major factor as it erodes the mental ability to understand the morality of the heinous act.
2.	Also unhappy marital relationships is another factor.
3.	Single parent families is also one of the factor.
4.	Neglected childhood is another factor.

A few other causes  are-

1.	The society is being transformed from rural to urban and backward to modern society and so the concept of morality and family norms are also being changed.
2.	Lack of religious education and degradation of moral standards leads people to commit such crimes.
Reactions seen in child, adolescent and adult survivors of incest :
Traumatic Sexualization:
•	Aversive feelings about sex 
•	Overvaluing sex 
•	Sexual identity problems 
•	Hypersexual or sexual avoidance 
Stigmatization:
•	Feelings of guilt/responsibility for the abuse 
•	Self-destructive behavior 
o	Substance abuse 
o	self-harm 
o	suicidal ideation 
o	risk-taking acts 
o	provocative behavior in order to encite punishment 
Betrayal:
•	Lack of trust, especially of those who were supposed to be protective and nurturing 
•	Avoidance of investment in others 
•	Manipulative behaviors 
•	Anger, acting-out and borderline behaviors 
•	Re-enacting the trauma through involvement in additional abusive or dangerous relationships 
Powerlessness:
•	Perception of vulnerability, victimization 
•	Desire to control and prevail- often exhibited as identification with the aggressor 
•	Avoidance- including dissociation, running away 
•	Anxiety- including phobias, sleep problems, eating problems, elimination problems, revictimization 

Incest is very much prevalent in India but the cases are never registered and even if registered no stringent actions are taken by the concerned authoroties. Yamin hazarika, DCP, CAW (Crime against Women) cell, however, observes that “cases of incest rape were now increasingly being reported as a result of awareness among mothers. However, majority of cases ended in acquittal as the complainant herself turned hostile or withdrew the case due to several social pressures” .     

The incest issues can be seen in every section of society, religious and ethnic background, seemed equally vulnerable to abuse. And the general view that incest can happen only in the lower classes is not true as it happens in all types of family. But its just that the upper strata is better at concealing it. And generally the cases reported involve a minor and the majority of cases are of father-daughter incest. And the cases involving mother and son are very rare because a mother’s role is of nurturing, caring and so she’ll find it very difficult to establish an incestuous relation in spite of having a desire for it.

PROVISIONS dealing with Incest in India

In India, incest is not even recognized as a specific offence, forget about punishing it. There is no separate provision dealing with incest in our present criminal justice system.  The cases of incest if ever reported are dealt under rape laws, though rape laws are inadequate to deal with the issue. Punishing a person committing incest under the rape laws will be like doing injustice to the victim as all the technicalities of rape laws need to be fulfilled which is not possible in a case of incest, where generally the victim is a child, and as a result persons committing such an immoral and unethical crime are generally acquitted. Moreover, I.P.C. unlike the Sexual Offences Act 1956  (in U.K.), does not prohibit sexual intercourse within prohibited degrees of relationship and therefore it does not make any distinction between an incestuous relative and a stranger who establishes sexual liaison with either an under-aged girl or a consenting adult woman .

The biggest difficulty with the existing laws on rape under Section 375  is that they are limited to penetrative abuse. The Law Commission of India in 2000 in its 172nd Report  has suggested replacing the offence of rape under Section 375, with the new offence of aggravated sexual assault. The new definition of sexual assault would include not only penile penetration  but also penetration by any other part of the body (like finger and toe) or by any other object including penile or oral, penile or anal, object or finger or vaginal and object or finger or anal should be made a separate offence. 

While minors have been sexually abused by their fathers, brothers, uncles and other trusted people, but the IPC does not come to their rescue. In the light of instances coming before courts, the Law Commission has suggested a modification to Section 376  also, to prescribe severe punishment when sexual assault is committed by the father, grandfather, brother or ‘any other person being in the position of trust or authority towards the other person .’A foreseeable problem with this provision is that it does not define a ‘position of trust or authority’. The United States Code Section 2243 (2), which deals with sexual abuse of a minor or ward, elaborates on the definition of authority, stating “under the custodial, supervisory, or disciplinary authority”. The adoption of similar definitions in Indian law would cover situations of incest within the family.

The Law Commission of India in its 172nd Report  has also recommended the inclusion of a new Section 376E that will deal exclusively with the offence of ‘unlawful sexual contact’ and covers a wide variety of offences including sexual harassment at work place and sexual perversions.

Incest also includes marriage within prohibited degrees of relationship and it is only this kind of incest for which we have a law to deal with it i.e. under Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which provides that marriage within prohibited degrees of relationship is prohibited. Except this there is no provision to deal with incest in our criminal justice system. Even in distinct Indian religions, marriage within prohibited degrees of relationship is prohibited as mentioned below:

Hinduism: Hinduism speaks of incest in highly abhorrent terms. Hindus were greatly fearful of the bad effects of incest and thus practice to date strict rules of both endogamy and exogamy, i.e., marriage in the same caste (varna) but not in the same family tree (gotra) or bloodline (Parivara). Marriages within the gotra ("swagotra" marriages) are banned under the rule of exogamy in the traditional matrimonial system. People within the gotra are regarded as kin and marrying such a person would be thought of as incest.
In some South Indian communities, where gotra membership passed from father to children, marriages were allowed between uncle and niece, while such marriages were forbidden in matrilineal communities, like Malayalis and Tuluvas, where gotra membership was passed down from the mother. A much more common characteristic of south Indian Hindu society is permission of marriage between cross-cousins (children of brother and sister). Thus, a man is allowed to marry his maternal uncle's daughter or his paternal aunt's daughter but is not allowed to marry his paternal uncle's daughter, a parallel cousin, who is treated as a sister .

Muslims: The Quran mentions incest which prohibits a man from having sexual relationships with his mother, daughter, sister, paternal aunt, maternal aunt or niece. However, Islam allows for marriage with cousins and other more distant relatives. Only in case of marriage does Islam allow sexual relations between cousins and other distant relatives . 

Parsis: Even in Parsis, marriage within prohibited degrees of relationship is prohibited, but it is practised at a very large scale among them. In them, marriage between cousins, even in very close relations is being practised. And this is one of the major reason, why we find a lot of Parsis with mental disorders, because we have scientific reasons behind this, as, if sexual intercourse takes place between prohibited degrees of relationship, the children born generally have genetic defects and diseases.

Christians: In Christians, their Holy Book of Leviticus lists prohibitions against sexual relations between various pairs of family members. Father and daughter, mother and son, and other pairs are forbidden, on pain of death, to have sexual relations. (Father–daughter incest is covered by a prohibition on sexual relationships between a man and any daughter born to any woman he has had sexual relationships with, thereby prohibiting his incest not only with his own daughters but also with women who could be his stepdaughters by marriage.)  

So incest is being practised in almost all religions in India but still we have no law to deal with such cases.

Problems Involved

The major problem with this issue is that lawsuits seeking damages for incest are not filed until several years after the abuse ceases.  Because of the delay in filing a lawsuit, the governing state statute of limitations presents an obstacle to prosecution . 
 
A very major problem with this issue is that the victims of it are generally not believed by other members of the family. And this is a major blockade in helping victims and survivors to have the confidence to reveal their experiences as their confessions are looked over as being fictitious. In 1896 Freud did an extensive research and was surprised by innumerous confessions of his female patients in which he discovered that many children have been sexually abused by their family members, especially their fathers. Freud could never accept that members of respectable families behaved in such a manner with their own children. Hence he decided to incriminate the victims instead. And declared that victims spoke untruths. Incriminating daughters instead of fathers gave Freud immense relief. And this belief is now so deeply ingrained in the culture that children who dare to report sexual assaults are more than likely to have their complaints dismissed as fantasy. Over the years many have tried to defeat this myth. Also with empowerment of women many have started to speak out even if reprimanded. Hence it’s becoming more and more difficult for the abusers to deny the existence of abuse . So its time that we provide this offence with a recognition, so that the wrong-doers can be punished.

Another major problem with this issue is that these cases are hardly reported because of family honour. When Meenakshi Apte, Head of the Family and Child Welfare Department at the Tata Institute of Social Science in Bombay, was researching on abortion, she discovered that most cases of teenage pregnancies were incest victims. Relatives used the protective confines of home to abuse children. It is usually an authoritarian male figure who is the breadwinner. The result is a conspiracy of silence both by the women of the family and the child. In an offensive society where grown women cannot voice disapproval, how can little girls speak out against adults or say no. Many women confess that they are forced to look the other way because they were dependent either on the husband or the in-laws and would rather preserve the family unit than destroy it . The position of a mother in the incestuous family is generally oppressed. She is dependent on her husband for everything. And so rather than objecting to her husband’s wrongful deeds she remain silent to maintain her marriage, her family, even if its price includes the sexual sacrifice of her daughter.

Also a very major problem with this issue is that to understand it we need a feminist perspective which is very difficult to establish by more than half of our population i.e. by males. And without a feminist analysis, one cannot understand why this was for so long suppressed by supposedly responsible professional investigators, why public discussion of the subject awaited women’s liberation movement . In our society male supremacy and female oppression is prevalent from times immemorial and this is the reason why in incest cases majority of perpetrators are uncles, fathers, elder brothers, stepfathers and even grandfathers, and majority of victims are nieces, younger sisters, daughters and even daughter-in-laws.

The word “incest,” denotes two quite different forms of behavior. Some forms are nonconsensual: the acts overlap with rape, statutory rape, or child abuse, or they take place in situations that are presumptively coercive because of an abundance of authority embodied in one family member and a high level of dependency on the part of the other. These nonconsensual acts are what most people associate with the word “incest.” This is understandable, given that most modern incest convictions are for behavior involving minors. However, consensual incest — when marriage or sexual relationships take place between consenting adults — does exist. The criminal incest laws in the vast majority of countries apply to this type of incest as well by making the crime distinct from the crime of rape .

In India there is a need for incest provisions to prevent sexual intercourse within the prohibited degrees of relationship, whether it is With Consent or Without Consent of any of the parties.

Incest : With or Without Consent

Incest can be with consent of both the parties or without consent of any of the parties.
      
When it is with consent
      
When incest is with consent it involves two consenting adults who, in private, indulge in incestuous sexual behaviour. And in such cases, law has failed to do anything because both the parties consented to it, so law can’t interfere. And this practise is continuing in our society and we have allowed it to grow even though it is against our social norms. And this can be very well seen from a Newspaper Article published  in Times of India wherein it was provided that a Muslim father, Ali, married his 15 year-old daughter, and made her pregnant, justifying his perverse act by claiming that he had divine sanction for his incestuous lust and what’s even more galling is that his wife, Sakina was the prime witness in the nikah of her daughter to her husband and no one in their district knew about the wedding. It was only after 6 months, when the girl showed signs of pregnancy that the word finally got out and outrage and anger swept across the village and there was even talk of attacking the family. So to control the situation, police arrested Ali, his wife Sakina and their daughter. They were then taken to a SDO’s court but the Magistrate had to release them because there was no complainant and even the Police did not bring a case of statutory rape against Ali. So it can be seen from such cases that we have allowed this heinous crime to grow because we do not have any law to punish such people.

It is a shameful crime committed by two persons closely  related to each other. And in our society this crime is not even recognised. It is being committed in private and in silence. And in many cases even if one of the parties refute to it later, the abusers resort to all exploitative and threatening measures, forcing the other party to continue the consensual incestuous relationship, so this cannot be ignored on the ground that it was consensual.

Another reason for its prohibition is that it is harmful both for those who participate in it and those who are directly involved i.e. the other family members . And the strongest argument for punishing adult consensual incest is the genetic one as it is claimed that when excessive inbreeding takes place, undesirable excessive genes become expressed and genetic defects and disease are more readily perpetuated and the children born are deleteriously affected .
When it is without consent

And even in the cases when incest is without consent of any of the parties, the cases are hardly reported because of family honour, fear, embarassment etc. And an analysis of a few cases shows that these cases generally involve a minor girl who is sexually assaulted by an authoritative male member of the family, can be her father, her brother, her uncle, her cousin but the most common is father-daughter incest. And the child who in many cases is even unaware about what is happening with her, continues to get exploited. And this sexual assault on a child is referred to as ‘incestuous assault’ by Butler, who defines the term as -
      
“any manual, oral or genital sexual contact or other explicit sexual behaviour that an adult family member imposes on a child, who is unable to alter or understand the adult’s behaviour because of his or her powerlessness in the family and early stage of psychological development. This type of incest is non consensual because the child has not yet developed an understanding of sexuality that allows him or her to make a free and fully conscious response to the adult behaviour ”

And even if such cases are reported it is dealt under rape laws and all the technicalities as of a rape case are followed, though there is a difference between the two, especially where the victim is a child. Because in case of child proper penile- penetration is generally not possible and the offence of rape requires that there should be penile-penetration and as a result these cases comes under the category of Section 354, 377 & 506 .,  and the accused is spared from the charge of rape.

Such an abuse of relationship of trust and dependency deserves to be treated as an aggravating factor while quantifying punitive measures against the perpetrators, but there is not even recognition of such an offence in our criminal justice system .
Dr. Alan Gilmour, Director, Britain’s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, further describes the gravity of the situation thus: 

“in the past a girl who revealed that she was being sexually abused by any of her family member was likely to be taken as a filthy minded liar , but with greater public awareness of this problem of incest and its recognition , it will be more likely that she might be listened to .” 

It should be treated as a specific offence, even though under rape laws but atleast a recognition should be given to it. Because its only after its recognition that we will be able to build a social fabric to record incest and then only we can expect incest victims to come up with their cases before the concerned authorities.

So, a recognition of this offence as well as a punishment is required for both, with consent as well as without consent, and in case of with consent, both the parties must be punished though the punishment may be lesser as compared to punishment for with consent.

The apathy faced by the victim in Sudesh Jhaku’s  case, where a father used to do sexual acts with his 6 year old daughter, but could not be charged under rape laws because proper-penile penetration was not there and was only charged under Section 354, 377 and 506 ., still remains today.

And the accused who committed such a heinous crime is let-off so easily and the punishment he gets under these Sections is nothing in comparison to the physical, psychological and emotional damage caused to the child by him.

It is therefore, high time to criminalize incest as a distinct offence for both with consent and without consent. A provision of incest is the need of the hour as it is very much prevalent in our society and this can be seen from the National Crime Records Bureau’s  statistics for the years 2000 to 2006 as given below in the form of pie charts indicating the age groups in which it is most prevalent –


Age-group wise victims of incest cases during 2000

The total numbers of cases reported during the year 2000 were 726.

So, from the National Crime Record Bureau’s (NCRB) statistics of 2000-2006, it can be inferred that this offence is very much prevalent in our society, its just that we are ignoring it or are scared to talk about it.

Also it can be further seen from the results of a Survey  conducted by a Ngo, RAHI (Recovering and Healing from Incest), that how prevalent this issue is in our society.

In 1998 a survey was conducted by RAHI, a NGO dealing with child sexual abuse victims. And the statistics as given in one of its publications, Voices from the Silent Zone- Women’s experiences of Incest and Childhood Sexual Abuse, are as given below - 

They got around 600 questionnaires filled up from middle class women and the results were shocking.

76% of these women were sexually abused.

 

76% of the respondents have been sexually abused in childhood or adolescence. 24% were not abused.


Out of these 76% -

40% were abused by family members,
31% were abused by known persons,
29% were abused by strangers.

 

29% have been abused only by strangers, 31% were abused only by persons known to them. 40% of the respondents have been abused by at least one family member. Together 71% of the respondents have been sexually abused by relatives or others they knew.

It is clear from the above figures that a very high number of women have experienced some form of sexual abuse as children or adolescents. Most of it has been perpetrated by someone known or close to them. The fact that the majority of the respondents have been abused by a family member shows that incest is widely prevalent.

It appears that a few NGOs are doing a lot to deal with this issue but their efforts alone cannot help in curbing this problem without any legal backing. So there is a need for a specific provision dealing with incest and involvement of more and more NGOs, so that the accused are not allowed to go scot-free which is happening because of absence of a specific provision on this issue.

So now its time for the Legislature to perform their part of the duty for curbing this social evil by giving this offence a recognition and treating it as a distinct offence.














INCEST: THE WORLD SCENARIO

Incest is not a issue new to our society. It was prevalent in our society since the olden times. The Egyptian Pharaohs have an established practise for them to marry their sisters to prevent the royal blood from being contaminated. Cambysee, the Persian king in 6th century B.C. had defined Persian law by marrying his own sister. Incest was committed by the protagonist Oedipus and his mother Jacosta and Oedipus was punished for his incestuous actions by blinding himself. According to Russel Middleton (1962) Cleopatra was married to two of her younger brothers at different times. Incestuous unions was considered as against the laws of God and man in Roman times .

And the practise of incestous relationship has been prohibited by                                         almost all civilised socities. The Code of Hammurabi in 1750 B.C. which was probably derived from Sumerian law (3500 B.C.), specified four prohibited acts of incest namely: (1) A man’s intercourse with his daughter, (2) with his daughter in law after the son’s marriage is consummated, (3) with his daughter in law before the son’s marriage is consummated, and (4) with his mother after his father’s death. It also provided for such punishment as banishment, drawing or burning of guilty and payment of some money to the victims .

Few of the common reasons adduced for the so-called ‘incest-taboo’ provide good grounds for legislation in modern times. The socio-anthropoligical theories depend, in many ways, on the supposed advantages to the tribe or clan of breeding out but such imaginings have no place in modern society, with its easy access to the opposite sex outside the immediate family .

Laws regarding incest are clearly enumerated and exist with punitive provisions in many countries like England, Poland, Australia, U.S etc. History of punishment for incest can be traced from cognizance by ecclesiastical courts to the Punishment of Incest Act 1908 in England . Judicial decisions such as Blackmore & Thorpe v. Brider  are strong evidence in favour of the seriousness attached to the ecclesiastical courts.

In this chapter, the researcher has dealt with the issue of incest as it is dealt with in various countries and the provisions regarding the same and a comparison amongst the laws of various countries and the Indian laws.


Provisions regarding incest in various other countries:


England


In England, the death penalty for incest was repealed under the regime of Elizabeth I, and reinstated under Oliver Cromwell. Incest was not a crime under Common law of England till 1908. Only in 1908 a statute making incest a misdemeanour was enacted in England . It provided that if the female was over sixteen years of age and consented, she too was culpable. The punishment was from 3 to 7 years. Then this Act of 1908 was repealed by Sexual Offences Act 1956, Section 10 and 11 of which contains provision regarding incest. The sections separately define the offence of incest for man and woman:

Section 10  defines incest as –

(1) It is an offence for a man to have sexual intercourse with a woman whom he knows to be his granddaughter, daughter, sister or mother. 
(2) In the foregoing subsection ‘sister’ includes half-sister, and for the purposes of that subsection any expression importing a relationship between two people shall be taken to apply notwithstanding that the relationship is not traced through lawful wedlock.

Section 11  defines incest as –

(1) It is an offence for a woman of the age of sixteen or over to permit a man who she knows to be her grandfather, father, brother or son to have sexual intercourse with her by her consent.
(2) In the foregoing subsection ’brother’ includes half-brother, and for the purposes of that subsection any expression importing a relationship between two people shall be taken to apply notwithstanding that the relationship is traced through lawful wedlock.
Under the Act incest by a man, if with a girl under thirteen, and so charged in the indictment is punishable with imprisonment for life, otherwise imprisonment for seven years. Incest by a woman is punishable with imprisonment for seven years. An attempt to commit incest by either a man or a woman is punishable with imprisonment for two years, but in case of incest with a girl under thirteen years, it is seven years.

So, Section 10 and 11 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 limits the offence to intercourse between three generations of relations in the direct line of descent or ascent and between siblings, the relationship persists in the illegitimate state and siblings of half-blood are included, but with a curious dispensation for grandmothers and grandsons . 

But what these Sections provide for is only sexual intercourse, which means that a man may have sexual relations other than vaginal intercourse with his mother, daughter, granddaughter, or sister. Eugenic considerations may be regarded as a justification for confining incest to sexual intercourse, but they were by no means crucial to the passage of the Incest Act in 1908 and the protection of children from sexual exploitation by parents was regarded as far more significant. But the sexual exploitation of a child does not only take the form of vaginal penetration by the penis. Other sexual acts may well be involved. Sometimes indecent assault of a small child is a preliminary to sexual intercourse when the child reaches puberty. The responsibility which parents have to ensure that sexual acts do not take place between themselves and their children is surely not confined to sexual intercourse. The breach of the special trust that exists between a child and a parent is no less violated where sexual acts other than vaginal penetration are induced or performed. The view of most experts is that ‘whatever form the assault takes, the scarring of the child can be deep and lasting’ .

The Criminal Law Revision Committee (hereinafter referred to as CLRC) of U.K. in 1984 shared the view that the primary aim of the law against incest is the protection of the young and vulnerable against sexual exploitation within the family and rejected the idea that eugenics was the law’s principal justification. It further commented that:

“It is not merely a question of unlawful sexual intercourse with a person who may not be in a position to give true consent. There is also a special dimension, the violation of the role of the family, which adds to the harmful consequences of incest. A child who suffers abuse at the hand of a stranger can expect comfort and protection from his or her family; incest victims often have no-one to whom to turn-those who should support have been the cause of the suffering .” 

These considerations also apply to other acts of sexual exploitation within the family such as buggery and oral sex. CLRC treated buggery as a grave form of abuse. Police Advisory Committee of U.K. expressed the view that ‘some indecent acts other than sexual intercourse, especially if repeated over any length of time, can perhaps be as harmful as sexual intercourse’. Despite this, both the committees took the view that incest should be confined to vaginal penetration by the penis .   

After this in 2003, came the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which is the first fundamental reform of the relevant law for over a century, the Sexual Offences Act1956 having been largely a consolidating measure. Section 25-29 and 64-65 contains a number of reformulated familial sex offences. Section 25-29 applies where one of the family members is under age 18. Child sexual abuse is not only a sexual offence, but one of the deepest breaches of trust which can take place in a family-based society. The home ought to be a place where young people can go to get away from fear and violence, and this fundamental feeling of safety can be destroyed by sexual abuse. Fathers may use their considerable power within the home to lead a daughter into sexual activity from a relatively early age. All kinds of pressure may be exerted on the child to keep quiet about the behaviour, with sometimes disastrous effects on his or her emotional development. Section 25 penalizes sexual touching of a family member under 18, with higher penalties where penetration is involved and lower penalties where the offence is committed by a family member also under 18, and that Section 26 penalizes the incitement of a family member to engage in sexual touching and this Section 26 further provides for a definition of family relationship which goes beyond close blood relations to cover a range of step-relations and foster parents living in the same household and regularly involved in caring for the young family member. Section 28 creates an exception for parties who are lawfully married, but that is not a convincing resolution of the issue of consensual sexual relations between adult members of the household and young family members aged 16 and 17. Further, Section 64 and 65 provides for offences of sex with adult relatives. Section 64 provides the offence of sexually penetrating a relative aged 18 or over, and Section 65 provides an offence of consenting to being sexually penetrated by a relative aged 18 or over. Both the offences have a maximum sentence of 2 years imprisonment. This extends the previous law of incest to cover oral, anal and vaginal sex and to include penetrative acts between consenting males .

So, Sec. 25-29 and Sec. 64-65  penalizes penetration as well as sexual touching and also the incitement for the same of a family member under 18, whether by a family member of the age below 18 or above 18. It also provides for a definition of family relationship. It also penalizes offences of sex with adult relatives whether with or without consent.

U.S.A.

In United States also incest is punishable even though their society is considered open society. The least severe penalty is of Virginia i.e., six months imprisonment or a five hundred dollar fine. And the most severe is of Maryland, permitting banishment and of California, which provides for a prison sentence from one to fifty years. The most common statutorily penalty is a maximum of ten years imprisonment with no mandatory minimum . 

In 1974, Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act was signed into law. This Act provided State mandate professionals to report the cases of child abuse and this resulted in reporting of lot many cases of child abuse including incest. Then in 1977, the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) developed 21 manuals (the User Manual Series) to provide guidance to professionals involved in the child protection system and to enhance community collaboration and the quality of services provided to children and families. Some manuals described professional roles and responsibilities in the prevention, identification, and treatment of child maltreatment. Other manuals in the series addressed special topics, for example, adolescent abuse and neglect .

Then in 1994, came the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) , which is a nonprofit corporation headquartered in Columbia, which has since 1994 provided help to the victims of sexual assault and educated the public about sexual assault prevention, prosecution and recovery. RAINN established and continues to operate the National Sexual Assault Hotline, a free, confidential telephone hotline that provides help, 24 hours a day, to victims nationally. More than 1,100 local rape crisis centers in the 50 States and the District of Columbia and with over 10000 volunteers and staff partner with RAINN and are members of the National Sexual Assault Hotline network. And to better serve victims of sexual assault, 80 percent of whom are under age 30 and 44 percent of whom are under age 18, RAINN will soon launch the National Sexual Assault Online Hotline, the web’s first secure hotline service offering live help 24 hours a day. Congress and the Department of Justice have given RAINN funding to conduct its crucial work. RAINN is a national model of public/private partnership, raising private sector funds to match congressional appropriations and receiving extensive private in-kind support, including advanced technology provided by the communications and technology industries to launch the National Sexual Assault Hotline and the National Sexual Assault Online Hotline. The programs sponsored by RAINN and its local affiliates have contributed to the increase in the percentage of victims who report their sexual abuse to law enforcement. 
The grants made to RAINN are used for the following purposes:

a.	operation of the National Sexual Assault Hotline, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line by which individuals may receive help and information from trained volunteers,
b.	operation of the National Sexual Assault Online Hotline, a 24-hour free online service by which individuals may receive help and information from trained volunteers,
c.	education of the media, the general public, and populations at risk of sexual assault about the incidence of sexual violence and sexual violence prevention, prosecution, and recovery,
d.	dissemination, on a national basis, of information relating to innovative and model programs, services, laws, legislation, and policies that benefit victims of sexual assault, and
e.	provision of technical assistance to law enforcement agencies, State and            local governments, the criminal justice system, public and private nonprofit agencies, and individuals in the investigation and prosecution of cases involving victims of sexual assault .

Incest provisions in various states of U.S.A

Incest is a statutory rather than common law prohibition. All fifty states and the District of Columbia have some variation of a prohibition of incest on the books; these include both criminal prescriptions (punishing either sexual behavior or marriage between persons too closely related) and marriage prescriptions (voiding marriages between persons too closely related or prohibiting clerks from issuing such persons marriage licenses). The criminal statutes vary widely; indeed, a few states impose no criminal penalties whatsoever on incestuous behavior.

Existing laws on incest range from antiquated incest laws which can be used to plea bargain (or charge bargain) child rape to minor penalties, to more intentional statutes, such as the Hawaii law that not only gives preferential treatment to incest perpetrators, it requires police to tell them they're special. 

In Delaware : A person is guilty of incest if the person engages in sexual intercourse with another person with whom the person has one of the following relationships:
A male and his child
A male and his grandchild etc.
The relationships referred to herein include blood relationships without regard to legitimacy and relationships by adoption.
Incest is an offence within the original jurisdiction of the Family Court.

In some of the States in U.S.A., criminals who raped children in their own home were eligible for probation instead of prison, but only if they entered a "recognized program of treatment."
In California : The only programs recognized by California were those treating the entire family. Thus the laws fueled and worked in tandem with a massive sex offender treatment industry to reunify perpetrators with their victims. The sex offender treatment industry claims that keeping sexual predators in the home with children, after a period of treatment, of course is in the child's best interest.

In Minnesota : In case of incest, the court may grant imprisonment upto ten years or even stay imposition or execution of the sentence if it finds that:

(a) a stay is in the best interest of the complainant or the family unit; and
(b) a professional assessment indicates that the offender has been accepted by and can respond to a treatment program.

If the court stays imposition or execution of sentence, it shall include the following as conditions of probation:

(1) incarceration in a local jail or workhouse;
(2) a requirement that the offender complete a treatment program; and
(3) a requirement that the offender have no unsupervised contact with the complainant until the offender has successfully completed the treatment program unless approved by the treatment program and the supervising correctional agent.

In Utah : In case of incest, the court may suspend execution of sentence and consider probation to a residential sexual abuse treatment center only if all of the following circumstances are found by the court to be present and the court in its discretion, considering the circumstances of the offence, including the nature, frequency, and duration of the conduct, and considering the best interests of the victim, finds probation to a residential sexual abuse treatment center to be proper:
(a) the defendant did not use a weapon, force, violence, substantial duress or menace, or threat of harm, in committing the offence or before or after committing the offence, in an attempt to frighten the victim or keep the victim from reporting the offence;
(b) the defendant did not cause bodily injury to the victim
(c) the defendant, prior to the offence, had not been convicted of any public offence in Utah or elsewhere involving sexual misconduct in the commission of the offence;
(d) the defendant did not commit any sexual offence, against more than one victim;
(e) the defendant did not use, show, or display pornography or create sexually-related photographs or tape recordings in the course of the offence;
(f) the defendant did not act in concert with another offender;
(g) the defendant did not encourage, aid, allow, or benefit from any act of prostitution or sexual act by the victim with any other person or sexual performance by the victim before any other person;
(h) the defendant admits the offence of which he has been convicted and has been accepted for mental health treatment in a residential sexual abuse treatment center;
(i) rehabilitation of the defendant through treatment is probable, based upon evidence provided by a treatment professional and who has accepted the defendant for treatment;
(j) prior to being sentenced, the defendant has undergone a complete psychological evaluation conducted by a professional and the professional's opinion is that the defendant is not an exclusive pedophile and does not present an immediate and present danger to the community if released on probation and placed in a residential sexual abuse treatment center; and the court accepts the opinion of the professional;
(k) if the offence is committed by a parent, stepparent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian of the child victim, the defendant shall, in addition to establishing all other conditions herein provided, establish that it is in the child victim's best interest that the defendant should not be imprisoned, by presenting evidence provided by a treatment professional who:
(i) is treating the child victim and understands that he will be treating the family as a whole; or
(ii) has assessed the child victim for purposes of treatment as ordered by the court based on a showing of good cause; 
(l) if probation is imposed,
(i) the defendant, as a condition of probation, may not reside in a home where children younger than 18 years of age reside for at least one year beginning with the commencement of treatment, and may not again take up residency in a home where children younger than 18 years of age reside during the period of probation until allowed to do so by order of the court.
(ii) A term of incarceration of at least 90 days is to be served prior to treatment and continue until the time when bed space is available at a residential sexual abuse treatment center and probation is to be imposed for up to a maximum of ten years.

In some States preferential treatment for criminals is applied. These laws are often based on theories promoted by the sex offender treatment industry that criminals who sexually abuse their own children are not true "pedophiles," and are thus uniquely amenable to treatment. And the best example of this theory can be seen in Washington.

In Washington : In case of incest, the court may grant an imprisonment ranging from 5 to 15 years, but generally in such cases, Special Sex Offender Sentencing Alternative (SSOSA) is well-established. An offender is eligible for the special sex offender sentencing alternative if:

(a) The offender has been convicted of a sex offence or a sex offence that is also a serious violent offence. If the conviction results from a guilty plea, the offender must, as part of his or her plea of guilty, voluntarily and affirmatively admit he or she committed all of the elements of the crime to which the offender is pleading guilty;
(b) The offender has no prior convictions for a sex offence;
(c) The offender has no prior adult convictions for a violent offence that was committed within five years;
(d) The offence did not result in substantial bodily harm to the victim;
(e) The offender had an established relationship with, or connection to, the victim such that the sole connection with the victim was not the commission of the crime; and
(f) The offender's standard sentence range for the offense includes the possibility of confinement for less than eleven years.

If the court finds the offender is eligible for this alternative, the court, on its own motion or the motion of the state or the offender, may order an examination to determine whether the offender is amenable to treatment. The examiner shall assess and report regarding the offender's amenability to treatment and relative risk to the community. The court shall order the offender to serve a term of confinement of up to twelve months. The court shall place the offender on community custody for the length of the suspended sentence, the length of the maximum term imposed or three years, whichever is greater. The sex offender treatment provider shall submit quarterly reports on the offender's progress in treatment to the court and the parties. The report shall reference the treatment plan and include at a minimum the following: Dates of attendance, offender's compliance with requirements, treatment activities, the offender's relative progress in treatment, and any other material specified by the court at sentencing. The court shall conduct a hearing on the offender's progress in treatment at least once a year.

In Hawaii : A person who has committed intra-family sexual assault may be considered for the expedited sentencing program. And the term, "intra-family" sexual assault means any criminal offence of felony sexual assault or incest, in which the victim of the offence is related to the defendant by consanguinity or marriage, or resides in the same dwelling unit as the defendant, and the victim was, at the time of the sexual assault, under the age of eighteen. The police department of the county in which the sexual assault took place or any other appropriate investigative law enforcement agency shall confer with the appropriate prosecuting authority. If the prosecuting authority determines that it is appropriate to provide notice of the expedited sentencing program to the defendant, the police department or other appropriate investigative law enforcement agency shall give the defendant written notice of the existence of the expedited sentencing program. The notice provision shall not be a prerequisite to questioning the defendant. The notice provision shall not obligate the prosecuting authority to issue a statement of "no objection" when considering the defendant for the expedited sentencing program.
The written notice shall state:

“You Are Advised To Seek Legal Counsel Immediately. If You Cannot Afford Private Counsel, Contact The Office Of The Public Defender. Failure To Contact An Attorney May Disqualify You From This Program. You are under investigation for a felony sexual assault against a minor. Upon completion of this investigation, if there is sufficient basis to believe that you have committed a sexual assault, the case will be referred to the appropriate prosecuting authority for review and possible institution of criminal charges. Hawaii law provides for a range of ordinary prison sentences for felony sexual assault ranging from five years up to twenty years, or life imprisonment, depending upon the offence. However, Hawaii Revised Statutes, provides that a person who commits a sexual assault upon a minor but who admits guilt, cooperates with the prosecuting authority, and participates in appropriate assessment and treatment may be considered for the expedited sentencing program. A person who is sentenced in accordance with the expedited sentencing program may be sentenced to a term of probation. Probation may be revoked, however, for failure to comply with the terms of the probation. To qualify for consideration for the expedited sentencing program, your legal counsel first must request from the office of the prosecuting authority named in this notice a written statement as to whether that office has any objection to your being considered for the expedited sentencing program. The court will not consider you for the expedited sentencing program under Hawaii revised statutes, unless your legal counsel has received a written statement that the appropriate prosecuting authority has no objection to your being considered for the expedited sentencing program and the request for that written statement was made within fourteen days of your receipt of this notice. Further, the court will not consider you for the expedited sentencing program under, unless, your legal counsel has received this notice, you have made a good faith effort to avoid the necessity of the child being removed from the family home, including but not limited to moving and remaining out of the family home until otherwise ordered by the court.”

The written notice also shall provide:
(a) Instructions on how to contact the appropriate prosecuting authority, including any necessary addresses and telephone numbers; and
(b) The name of the person delivering the notice and the date it was given to the alleged offender.

A defendant shall not be considered by the court for the expedited sentencing program under this section unless the defendant's legal counsel requests within fourteen days of the defendant's receipt of the written notice, that the defendant be considered for the expedited sentencing program, and defendant's counsel subsequently receives a written statement from the appropriate prosecuting authority stating that it has no objection to the defendant being considered for the expedited sentencing program in accordance with this section. Additionally, each of the following criteria shall be met:

(a) After receiving the required written notice, the defendant made a good faith effort to avoid the necessity of the child being removed from the family home, including but not limited to moving and remaining out of the family home until otherwise ordered by the court;
(b) The victim of the sexual assault was under the age of eighteen when the sexual assault was committed;
(c) The defendant was never previously sentenced for the same offence and has never been convicted of felony sexual assault or incest;
(d) A guardian ad litem appointed in a family court proceeding, or a person assigned by the Children's Advocacy Center to serve as guardian ad litem, agreed that it would be in the best interest of the child, for the defendant to be considered for the expedited sentencing program. No prosecuting authority shall issue a statement of no objection without this prior agreement; and
(e) The defendant has complied with the requirements for consideration for the expedited sentencing program; provided that at sentencing the prosecuting authority may oppose the defendant's participation in the expedited sentencing program if the prosecuting authority determines that the defendant has failed to satisfy the abovementioned criteria 
The prosecuting authority and the child's guardian ad litem may consult with any other appropriate agency or individual to assist in a decision whether to provide a written statement of “no objection” prior to the defendant being considered for sentencing under the expedited sentencing program.

Within seven business days of receipt of the written notice stating that the appropriate prosecuting authority has no objection to the defendant being considered for the expedited sentencing program in accordance with this section, unless the prosecuting authority waives compliance with the time limit, the defendant shall:

(a) Continue to make a good faith effort to avoid the necessity of the child being removed from the family home, including but not limited to moving and remaining out of the family home until otherwise ordered by the court;
(b) Admit to commission of the sexual assault to the police department of the county in which the assault took place or other appropriate investigative law enforcement agency;
(c) Provide to the appropriate prosecuting authority a written waiver of indictment and preliminary hearing for any criminal charges arising from the sexual assault; and
(d) Enter a voluntary plea of guilty to the charge or charges alleged upon or following arrangement.

A defendant considered for the expedited sentencing program under this section when sentence is imposed may be sentenced to a term of probation, provided that if the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment as a condition of probation, the term of imprisonment may allow for the defendant's retention of employment. The term of probation shall vary from ten years to twenty years depending upon the offence.
In addition to the conditions of probation provided, a sentence under this section shall include that the defendant shall:

(a) Participate in court approved, appropriate sex offender assessment and treatment that shall conform to the guidelines developed by the adult probation division of the appropriate circuit court, until clinically discharged; provided that:
(i) The prosecuting authority shall be provided notice and the opportunity for a hearing prior to any authorization for treatment discontinuance by the court or the adult probation division;
(ii) The defendant shall pay for the cost of the assessment and treatment to the extent that the defendant has the ability to do so; and
(iii) A lack of assessment and treatment resources shall result in the defendant not being considered for the expedited sentencing program;
(b) Provide a written waiver of confidentiality for any assessment, treatment, counselling, therapy, or other program ordered as a condition of probation;
(c) Comply with all orders entered in a proceeding; and
(d) Comply with other condition deemed by the court to be reasonably necessary for the protection of the victim of the sexual assault or the rehabilitation of the defendant.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption in favour of the court imposing a sentence in accordance with this section when a defendant qualifies for the expedited sentencing program, and written notice of “no objection” is issued by the prosecuting authority. The court shall provide written findings of fact setting forth specific reasons justifying imposition of a sentence.

Massachussets  issues a penalty of upto 20 years imprisonment for those engaging in sexual activities with relatives closer than first cousins.
 
So, it can be seen that in various states of U.S.A, there are proper provisions of incest or various treatment programs, i.e., either they provide harsher punishment to the incest victim or conducts treatment program for him. So atleast the issue is taken care of.
  


Israel 
Incest existed in Israel, even when it was never admitted or discussed. And in last few years, the problem has become much more acute. So they came up with a Israel Association for Child Protection (hereinafter referred to as ELI) for child victims of abuse, because in most of the cases the incest victims are children only. The Director of ELI, commented on the situation in Israel that,
“Fathers are sharing their daughters, over 90% of incest victims are girls.” 
Between 1995 and 1998, the number of incest victims treated at ELI ran to 300. In 1999, though, the figure leaped to 811, and in the first six months of 2000, 546 incest cases were reported. And the number of victims was going up not only because people were reporting it more but also because the actual incidence of incest is on the increase as well. Based on past research of child abuse, ELI’s guess was that the true number of incest victims is about 10 times the number reported. Over half of ELI's cases involve incest. But with the growing incidents of incest, even the courts have begun handing out harsher sentences for incest, which varies from 20 years, 19 years, 15 years depending on case to case, as compared to the punishments which were given before like 6 months or a year.
Also in Israel there is a National Council for Protection of Child and this organization helps incest victims report the crime by easing their way through the justice system, from their first visit to the police station to their testimony in court.
ELI even has a clinic, where children who are removed from their families are kept and are counseled etc. And all efforts have been made to make this clinic look cheerful, like the walls are painted colourful and there are dolls and games all over the place.
The rate of incest in Israel is more or less equal to that in other "developed" countries, but its just that, in the Fifties, Sixties, and Seventies and even, to a lesser degree, in the Eighties, the thinking was that incest didn't exist here, it wasn't something that Jews did. Israel was in total denial. But in the last 10 years Israel has passed that stage, and there's a great deal of awareness of the problem, and a much, much greater willingness to confront it.
The Director of ELI, noted that,
“There is no link between incest and socioeconomic distress. If incest is associated with the poor and backward more than with the wealthy and sophisticated, this is because the rich can hide it better than can the poor.” Also she further commented that,
“Incest is not caused by social problems, for it to happen, the primary cause of incest must be present, and the primary cause, is an inability to empathize with one's child, to see the child as a person in her or his own right, as someone who can feel pain. Instead the incestuous parent sees the child merely as an instrument to satisfy his own needs. And just like with rape, sexual gratification is not the important thing with incest; sex is only a symbol of the exertion of power. But, if the primary cause is present in the family, and in addition, if the family suffers from poverty, drugs, alcohol, and such, then these social problems may contribute to bringing the incestuous tendency to the surface.”
Bangladesh  also has enacted a law making incest punishable with death. 

In China , the State promotes alround development of the children and young people, morally, intellectually and physically, whereas maltreatment which necessarily includes sexual abuse and incestuous relationships with the children is prohibited. 

Under Greek and Roman law also incest was prohibited .

In Scotland the maximum penalty for incest cases is life imprisonment .

Also in 1984, Criminal Law Revision Committee (U.K.) and the Scottish Law Commission  gave a few reasons for criminalization and retention of incest as a distinct offence. Some of the prominent reasons given were –

1.	In changing, often exploitative attitudes towards sexuality and sexual relationships, criminalization of incest becomes imminent as it causes harm to the persons associated therewith as well as to ‘others’.
2.	Criminal law must convey that it attaches significance to the sexual intercourse between blood relatives with a view to preventing harm to others.
3.	The existence of sexual relation within family arouses horror and disgust.
4.	The breach of trust, the destruction of familial boundaries, the genetic risks, do justify the criminalisation of incest.
5.	The destructive nature of incest and its gravity has to be conveyed by the existence of a specific crime.
6.	The social meaning of non-criminalisation of incestuous conduct after a certain age would be an indication that our society tolerates it and is open to such conduct.

In Australia  marriage between an ancestor and descendant or between a brother and sister (including siblings of half-blood), is not permitted and these "prohibited relationships" include relationships traced through adoption. Moreover, incest is a crime in every Australian state and self-governing territory, but unsurprisingly definitions and penalties vary. In all states and territories the legal definition of incest covers sex, whether heterosexual or homosexual, between a parent and child, as well as between siblings (including half-brothers and half-sisters). Whether the definition of incest extends to sex between a step-parent and step-child or adoptive relationships varies from state to state. However, recent research carried out suggests that around 15-20% of white australians have, at one stage of their lives, had incest. While at the time these claims were met with outrage and disbelief, the data was verified by a seperate and independent survey carried out recently in 2007.
In all jurisdictions except South Australia, the definition also includes sex between a grandparent and a grandchild and in all other jurisdictions except New South Wales it also covers sex between a "lineal ancestor" and a "lineal descendant" (which would include the relationship of great-grandparent/great-grandchild and beyond). Only in Queensland is incest defined to include sex between an uncle or aunt and a niece or nephew, although even here its application would appear to be curtailed by the effect of federal marriage law. The Queensland Criminal Code itself provides that the crime of incest does not apply to "persons who are lawfully married or entitled to be lawfully married" and Australian marriage law permits (heterosexual) marriage between an aunt or uncle and a nephew or niece, provided both parties are of marriageable age (currently 18). In New South Wales the crime of incest only applies where the victim is aged 16 or over (the age of consent in that state); in cases where the victim is under 16 the accused would be charged with the general offence of sexual intercourse with a child.
In all other jurisdictions the crime of incest also exists where the victim is below the age of consent, but this does not exclude the possibility of bringing the more general charge of sexual intercourse with a child. This is particularly relevant where a certain form of sexual conduct between related persons falls outside the legal definition of incest in a particular jurisdiction.
In no Australian state or territory is consent a defence to the crime of incest. The penalty for incest varies from state to state. A conviction for incest attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years in Victoria (25 years in the case of sex with one's child, step-child or lineal descendant, irrespective of the victim's age), 7 years in South Australia, 8 years in New South Wales, 10 years in Western Australia (20 years if the victim is under 16), 10 years in the Australian Capital Territory (20 years if the victim is under 10 and 15 years if the victim is aged 10-15), 14 years in the Northern Territory (25 years if the victim is under 10 and 20 years if the victim is aged 10-15), 21 years in Tasmania, and imprisonment for life in Queensland.
In France , incest is not a crime; incest laws were abolished by Napoleon some 200 years ago for uncertain reasons. 
In Belgium , incest is not a crime; incest laws were abolished by Napoleon some 200 years ago in the French government period. Incestuous relations between a parent and minor child are prohibited and punished by law in Belgium, but not between adults.
Under Canadian  law persons who are related lineally, or as brother or sister or half-brother or half-sister, including by adoption may not marry. Incest, which covers sex with one's parent, child, brother or sister (including half-brothers and half-sisters), grandparent or grandchild, is also an indictable offence and liable to a maximum of 14 years' imprisonment. 
In Poland , incest is defined in Article 201 of the Penal Code as sexual intercourse with an ancestor, a descendant, a guardian, a ward, a brother, or a sister - is punishable by 3 months up to 5 years imprisonment.

In Sweden  marriage between siblings who share one parent is allowed.

In Islamic Countries, Quran mentions incest which prohibits a man from having sexual relationships with his mother, daughter or sister paternal aunt, maternal aunt, and niece. However, Islam allows for marriage with cousins and other more distant relatives. Only in case of marriage does Islam allow sexual relations between cousins and other distant relatives .

Islamic law does not provide separate punishment for incest. It provides similar punishement as for rape or adultery, and that is “stored to death”. It also does not make any distinction on the ground of sex or consent. So it makes both male and female liable and also for consensual acts. There cannot be more harsher puishment then this .

Germany
The German incest law already existed in the criminal code of 1871, called Criminal Code of the German Realm. Even before that the different German legal systems included incest crime laws very similar to today’s. One of the first incest laws however did already exist within the Code of Hammurabi, a set of laws inscribed in stone at the time of 1760 BC. And even today incest is punishable under the German law under Article 173 of the German Criminal Code, which provides that, sexual relations between siblings is punishable by a fine or up to two years in prison . 
And the application of German incest law can be well seen from the case of a German brother and sister, Patrick Stübing and Susan Karolewski, who called for the country's incest laws to be abolished in February 2007, so that they could continue their sexual relationship. Although they were born into the same family, Patrick was not living with them when Susan was born and they met for the first time in 2000. Between 2002 and 2006 they had four children although three have been taken into foster care. Two of the children have disabilities and while it is possible that these were caused by inbreeding, premature birth may also have contributed. The siblings' lawyer, Endrik Wilhelm, lodged an appeal with Germany's highest judicial body, the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, to overturn the country's ban on incest. On March 13th 2008 however, the court ruled with a 7-1 vote for incest to remain illegal and he will now have to serve a two-and-a-half year prison sentence . 

Papua New Guinea 

In Papua New Guinea, lot many changes took place in the provisions prescribing incest.

Section. 223 and 224 of the Criminal Code provided for incest as:

Section 223. Incest by man.

(1) A person who carnally knows a woman or girl who is, to his knowledge –

(a) his daughter or other lineal descendant; or
(b) his sister; or
(c) his mother,
is guilty of a crime.

Penalty: Imprisonment for life.

Section 224. Incest by adult female.

(1) A woman or girl of or above the age of 18 years who permits –

(a) her father or other lineal ancestor; or
(b) her brother; or
(c) her son,
to have carnal knowledge of her, knowing him to be her father, or other lineal ancestor, her brother or her son, as the case may be, is guilty of a misdemeanour.

Penalty: Imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years.

Under these provisions, the crime of incest was restricted to persons who were related only by blood such

In 2001, both these Sections were amended, as:

Section. 223. Incest by man.

(1) A person who carnally knows a woman or girl who is, to his knowledge –

(a) his daughter, step daughter, adopted daughter, whether by custom or otherwise or other lineal descendant; or
(b) his sister; step sister, half sister or adopted sister, whether by custom or otherwise; or
(c) his mother, step mother, foster mother or guardian to whom the person is wholly dependent for his livelihood and sustainence (sic); or
(d) his niece, 
is guilty of a crime.

Penalty: Imprisonment for life.

Section. 224. Incest by adult female.

(1) A woman or girl of or above the age of 18 years who permits –

(a) her father, step father, foster father or guardian to whom this person is wholly dependent for her livelihood and sustainence (sic) or other lineal ancestor; or
(b) her brother; step brother or adopted brother, whether by custom or otherwise; or
(c) her son, step son, adopted son, whether by custom or otherwise; or
(d) her nephew
to have carnal knowledge of her, knowing him to be her father, step father, guardian to whom the person is wholly dependent for her sustainence (sic) or other lineal ancestor, her brother, step brother, half brother, adopted brother, whether by custom or otherwise, or her son, step son, adopted son, whether by custom or otherwise or her nephew as the case may be, is guilty of a misdemeanour.
Penalty: Imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years.

The greatest difficulty presented by these amendments concerned the issue of determining if a particular category of ‘relatives’ described in the amendments existed at the time the alleged incestuous intercourse took place. The difficulties related particularly and only to ‘relatives’ described as ‘customarily adopted daughter, son, sister or brother’ and "foster mother/father or guardian to whom this person is wholly dependent for his/her livelihood and sustenance.

Then in March 2002 came the Criminal Code (Sexual Offences and Crimes Against Children) Act 2002.

Section 13 of the 2002 Act repealed Sections 223 and 224 of the Code and replaced them with a single Section. 223. This provides:

Section. 223. Incest 

(1) A person who engages in an act of sexual penetration with a close blood relative, is guilty of a crime

Penalty: Imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years.

(2) For the purposes of this section, a close blood relative means a parent, son, daughter, sibling (including a half-brother or half-sister), grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew or first cousin, being a family member from birth and not from marriage or adoption.

(3) No person shall be found guilty of an offence under this section if, at the time of the act of sexual penetration occurred, he or she was under restraint, duress or fear of the other person engaged in the act.

So, even in Papua New Guinea, there laws regarding incest kept changing to meet the prevalent situation in that country. They have a proper provision dealing with incest in their country, because even they understand how serious this problem is and its irreparable consequences on the victim. 

So, in so many countries there are proper provisions to deal with incest. And the punishments are also stringent. The Criminal Codes of these countries clearly gives a proper definition of what incest actually mean and what should be the punishment for it depending upon the relations between whom it occurred. So this shows that a lot many countries understands the gravity of the offence and considers it a very serious crime which cannot be neglected upon. 

So now its time for India to look upon this issue seriously and deal with it in a manner it is dealt with in so many foreign countries. And to begin with we need a law, a provision to deal with this issue.












JUDICIAL RESPONSE ON THE ISSUE OF     
      INCEST IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES

The various judicial pronouncements that the court gave in such matters has been traced below.

Few judicial pronouncements of India:

In 1995 came the case of Sudesh Jhaku v. K.C.J. . In this case K.C.J., father of 3 daughters, was Under Secretary in the Union Home Ministry. His youngest daughter was 6 years old and was used to be taken by her father to his office and from there to a hotel. There he along with his 4 colleagues (including 2 women), in the company of the girl, used to consume alcohol, watch what are generally known as "blue films" and revel in sex orgies. And during those naked games of raw flesh, KCJ would make his own daughter consume alcohol, remove her clothes, and thrust his fingers in her vagina and anus. And at home also he used to do such sexual acts with her. So the child was not safe even within the four walls of the house she called her home. The father was charged by C.B.I. under Sections 376, 377, 354 and 366A  read with Section 109A. However, the Additional Sessions Judge charged him under Section 354, 377 and 506 and his colleagues under Section 109 for having abetted the commission of offences under Section 354 and 377. However, the mother of the child on whose complaint the case was registered was not satisfied with the order of charge and she through a revision petition urged the Delhi High Court, to charge her husband in addition to abovementioned charges, under Section 376 and 366A of I.P.C. 

But the High Court held that the words ‘sexual intercourse’ and ‘penetration’, which have all along been taken to mean only the penile-vaginal penetration, cannot be interpreted to bring within their fold the vaginal penetration by fingers or any other object and dismissed the review petition. But the Judge also stressed upon the need for an appropriate legislative intervention to bring the desired changes in the substantive criminal law.  

So in this case, the father who committed such a heinous crime was let-off so easily and the punishment he gets under these Sections is nothing in comparison to the physical, psychological and emotional damage caused to the child by him, just because we had no law to deal with this issue.

Then in 1997, Sakshi, a voluntary organisation dealing in issues concerning women, filed a PIL (Sakshi v. Union of India ) seeking a wider definition of rape and sexual abuse to overcome the judicial apathy reflected in the Sudesh Jhaku’s case. Sakshi urged the Supreme Court to consider the following precise issues -

•	The expression ‘rape’ should be replaced by sexual assault so that any kind of sexual violence, even without actual penetration should be punished. And all forms of penetration should be included such as penile/vaginal; penile/oral; penile/anal; finger/vaginal; finger/anal and object/vaginal penetration.
•	A complete recasting of Section 376  with inclusion of the following paragraph, “If the sexual assault is committed by a person in a position of trust or authority towards the person assaulted or by a near relative of the person assaulted, he/she shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to life  imprisonment and shall also be liable to fine”. 

And the Law Commission in its 172nd Report  recommended the following changes to be made in Indian Penal Code 1860, but none of these recommendations has been implemented till date.

Till date there is no provision on incest in our criminal justice system, even our rape laws are silent on the issue, so if these recommendations of Law Commission are implemented, it will atleast provide recognition to this issue which is the need of the hour. 

The Supreme Court in the case of Satish Mehra v. Delhi Administration,  dismissed the charges against the abuser and in turn the horror of incestuous abuse of the child as a serious crime. The court found the accusations of child abuse against the father ‘eerie’ and ‘incredulous’ in spite of the medical examination called on the 8 year old girl which revealed ‘a wide vaginal opening, wider than expected of their age group.’ The mother in this case submitted that the father had been sexually abusing their daughter from the age of three while they were in US. She supported this case with reports from child psychotherapists, doctors and the police in India and the United States. The most shocking part of the judgement was the insinuation that a father is incapable of abusing his child. And the medical evidence that the girl had been sexually abused was not taken seriously.                            

In another case of Vadgoon, Maharashtra, the mother of the victim was unable to suffer the pain of seeing her husband having sex with her eight years old daughter, so she decided to take the law into her own hands. Initially she implored him to spare the child. But he didn’t listen to her, saying he had every right to enjoy the fruits of what he has sown. Finally in despair, she stabbed him to death. And, in a rare case of sensitivity shown by the courts, she was acquitted with merely strict warning.

In another matter of Phul Singh v. State of Haryana,  a 22 year old man was convicted to 4 years rigorous imprisonment by the session court for raping his cousin. The High Court in appeal affirmed the conviction but the Hon’ble Supreme Court reduced the sentence to 2 years. Krishna Iyer J. observed that the offender was in his early twenties and that there was no sign of repetition of the offence and the parents of the victim had also forgiven the molester.

In another case of M.G. Kakkar v. Naval Dubey,  a medical practitioner, Naval Dubey was accused of raping a girl and was also accused of committing the same offence earlier on his niece and her friends of the locality, the Supreme Court expressed the view that offenders of all sexual assaults on children particularly female, are all a menace to the civilized society and should be mercilessly and inexorably punished in the severest terms. ‘We feel that the judges who bear the sword of justice should not hesitate to use that sword with the utmost severity, to the full and to the end if the gravity of the offences so demand’ observed the court and ruled while directing the medical practitioner to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 7 years and to pay a fine of Rs. 25, 000 in default to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 18 months. The court also ruled that the fine amount, if realized, shall be paid to the victim girl. 

In the above two matters, discrepancy of the court while granting punishment could be seen, therefore, in accordance with the phrase should be punished in severest terms, used by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in all cases of incestuous assault on children, the punishment prescribed by the courts should be life imprisonment. 

In the case of Gajratan v. State of Chhatisgarh,  a father raped his daughter several times after beating her. In this case, the court sentenced the father to life imprisonment.

In another matter of Mohd. Alam v. State (NCT of Delhi),  the stepfather committed rape on his 10 year old daughter. The court found it unacceptable and gave him 10 years imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 500. 

In the case of Sawant v. State of Madhya Pradesh,  the father-in-law of the victim committed rape on her. He was sentenced to 7 years Rigorous Imprisonment. 

The court of Himachal Pradesh gave life sentence and a fine of Rs. 25,000 to a man who had raped his minor daughter. This was held in the case of State of Himachal Pradesh v. Asha Ram. 

In another case of Sukhdev Anand v. State of Himachal Pradesh,  the father raped his daughter. The girl was a minor and her age was between 15-17 years. The father was convicted under Section 376 I.P.C. for 10 years along with a fine of Rs. 20,000. A further sentence of 2 years along with a fine of Rs. 5,000 was levied on him under Section 506 of I.P.C. 

In the case of Chhabu Ram v. State of Himachal Pradesh,  the accused was more than 60 years old. Despite the limitations of his age, he raped his minor granddaughter on several occasions. The court condemned the act of the accused and convicted him accordingly. Analyzing cases like this, it can be pointed out that such a condition is despicable and appalling and surely demands adequate attention so that action can be taken against such anti social acts.          

Sexual abuse of children is far more prevalent than most people realize. At least 25% of the adult population of this country has been molested as children. 25% of girls are molested before the age of 16. At least 27 million females are current or future adult survivors of child sexual abuse. Incest is the most common form of child abuse.  This leads to emotional and mental complications for the victim. A case highlighted on such an issue is the case of State v. Anthony Nicholas,  where the father was charge sheeted for outraging the modesty of his own daughter and for abetment of suicide. The accused was convicted on the basis of the Dying Declaration of the victim. He was convicted under Section 306 of ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬I.P.C. with a rigorous imprisonment for 10 years along with a fine of Rs. 5,000 and further punishment under Section 354  with 2 years imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 500. 

There are many cases where the person closely related to the victim has broken her trust by committing such acts of heinousness. Another instance was in the matter of Kokkiligadda Veeraswamy v. State of Andhra Pradesh,  where the accused was closely related to the victim and committed rape on her. He was convicted under Section 376  with rigorous imprisonment of 7 years along with a fine of Rs. 10,000 and under Section 306 with rigorous imprisonment of 5 years with a fine of Rs. 1,000. 

In a further case of Hare Krishna Ram alias Hare Kishan Das v. State of Bihar,  the father-in-law of the victim who was 60 years old raped her twice. He was sentenced with 10 years rigorous imprisonment.

Though the results above have been quite encouraging but despite the efforts there are also matters where the accused could not be convicted or sentenced due to procedural lapses or other such disadvantages. The case in question is Mohan Singh v. State of Rajasthan,  where the father-in-law was alleged to have committed rape on his daughter-in-law. The accused was acquitted in this case as the testimony of the victim couldn’t be relied upon and the evidence of the prosecution could not be corroborated. 

In the case of Abdul Wahid B.A. Shaikh v. State of Maharashtra,  the father was charged with having committed a sexual assault on his 8 year old daughter. The Bombay High Court reduced life imprisonment to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and held that the appellant is a hutment dweller and that his poverty has placed him in a difficult situation of having to sleep huddled up in a tiny area. The records also indicated that his wife had left him 3 years back and the appellant comes from the weakest strata of society having been deprived of any form of education, and having struggled through life with no opportunity of even acquiring a basic understanding of elementary issues of propriety. There was nothing on record to indicate that the accused has a record of sexual violence or even any misbehavior. On the other hand, even though his wife had left him with the minor school going children, he had arranged for their meals, provided them with toys and pocket money and even cooked the night meal for them. These mitigating circumstances, the court held lead them to accept that it was a momentary lapse but on the other hand, there were factors which impelled them to keep it within reasonable limits. 
An analysis of these cases shows that the judiciary’s response towards the issue of incest is mixed. In some cases they’ve awarded stringent punishments while in some they’ve even acquitted the accused on account of technicalities. The punishments when granted are only if there is sexual intercourse, then it comes under the category of rape and is punished thereunder. And in other cases where sexual intercourse is not there, the accused can be maximum punished under the Section. 354 of I.P.C, outraging the modesty of the woman, but is it just outraging modesty. Many a times the accused is acquitted because the judges have no category of offence to punish them under it. 
Few judicial pronouncements of various foreign countries:

In a Japanese case, Aizawa v. Japan , Chiyo Aizawa was the first child of her parents. Her father suffered from alcoholism. He used to have sexual intercourse with his daughter since 1953. Her mother escaped from him to some other State soon after, leaving her at the mercy of his father. Her mother returned several years after but by that time, he has started living with his daughter only. She had been pregnant eleven times and had five daughters by her father, but two of them died soon. In 1967, she took sterilization after her sixth induced abortion. In 1968, she fell in love with a man and her father became angry and confined her and said that he would kill her three children. And on October 5, 1968 she murdered her father. The police determined that the three children were her father’s children only. Indeed, those around her had thought that she was her father’s wife until the arrest. The Japanese law forbids endogamy, polygamy but does not forbid incest. Her children were recorded as his illegitimate children. 

In Japan, the punishment for parricide was death penalty or life imprisonment under Article 200 of Penal Code. Her lawyer insisted that her committing murder was in self-defense and also insisted that she had been insane due to sexual abuse. The lower court suspended her sentence insisting that Article 200 of Penal Code was unconstitutional, but the High Court didn’t agree with it. The Japanese Supreme Court finally sentenced her to 2 years 6 months in prison and 3 years suspended sentence. 

So even the courts showed sensitivity in such a case of incest, where the daughter murdered her father as a last resort, after tolerating his lust for almost 15 years. So this shows that even the courts are sympathetic towards such a heinous crime of incest.

In a case in United States, Allen v. Frank , Allen Muth and his younger sister Patricia married when they attained the age of majority and had three children. After they abandoned the middle child, who was disabled, the State of Wisconsin petitioned to terminate their parental rights because of their incestuous parenthood. 

On appeal to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, Patricia and Allen challenged the constitutionality of Wisconsin Statute, which provides that incestuous parenthood is a
ground for termination of parental rights. The Muths claimed that the termination of their parental rights based on their incestuous parenthood of Tiffany denied them due process of law and their rights to equal protection of the law. The court denied those claims and affirmed the trial court.

After the courts approved the termination, both Allen and Patricia were arrested by the State of Wisconsin in 1997 and charged with incest in violation of Wisconsin’s criminal incest statute, which provides that:
“Whoever marries or has nonmarital sexual intercourse with a person he or she knows is a blood relative and such relative is in fact related in a degree within which the marriage of the parties is prohibited by the law of this state is guilty of a Class F felony.”

Prior to trial, Allen moved to dismiss the criminal complaint against him, on the basis that Wisconsin’s incest statute was unconstitutional insofar as it sought to criminalize a sexual relationship between two consenting adults. The trial court denied the motion and conducted a bench trial. Both Allen and Patricia were convicted on November 11, 1997. Allen was sentenced to eight years in prison and Patricia was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.

The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed Allen’s conviction in January 2000. In its opinion, the court noted that the issue before it was whether Wisconsin’s incest statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals also noted that it agreed with the trial court’s conclusion that Allen Muth had no right in having sexual relations with his sister and concluded that the State may legitimately prohibit incestuous relationships. The Wisconsin Supreme Court  denied Muth’s petition for discretionary review.

Having exhausted all State remedies, in 2001, Muth filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on the ground that Wisconsin’s incest statute is unconstitutional insofar as it seeks to criminalize a sexual relationship between two consenting adults. In 2003, the District Court denied Muth’s petition. In 2003, came the decision in the case of Lawrence v. Texas , which was a case regarding sodomy between two consenting adults and the law banning sodomy between two consenting adults was held to be unconstitutional by the court. But in this case, the court refused to consider Lawrence v. Texas decision in the present case on the ground that sodomy is different from incest, as it involves familial relations, and so this heinous crime cannot be allowed to continue on this plea.

And finally in 2005, United States Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s decision.

So from this case it can be seen, that in Wisconsin (U.S.A) there is a proper provision in their criminal statute for incest, which provides that any person marrying or having sexual intercourse with someone within prohibited degrees is punishable, even though both the parties consented to it. Both the parties will be punished for committing such a heinous crime.

In another U.K. case, Attorney General’s Reference No. 8 of 2005 , the offender is the natural father of the victim. The offender was a heavy drinker and he was, from time to time, violent to his wife and to the children. From the age of about 12 he began a course of sexual abuse towards the victim which continued till she attained the age of 27, initially touching her breasts over her clothes, progressing to touching her naked breasts and private parts and then digital penetration of the vagina. That conduct spanned a period of about 2 years. The offender then raped the victim on four occasions and thereafter continued regularly to have incestuous sexual intercourse with her. In consequence, she twice conceived and one child has survived. During her second pregnancy, she met a young man with whom she entered into a relationship in 1995. In 2002, she left the family home to live with the other man. The offender did not allow her to take with her the boy, who was the product of her relationship with the offender with her. In July 2003 she disclosed the abuse, at first to a friend, then to the man with whom she was living and subsequently to the police. The last incident of abuse occurred in February 2003. In one of her statements to the police she said that she always covered her face and would silently cry when the abuse was taking place. But that distress did nothing to dissuade the offender. She came to accept the abuse as part of her life. As a result, the offender was arrested in September 2003. And the Manchester Crown Court granted him an imprisonment for a period of 5 years. But on an Appeal by the Attorney General, the Court of Appeal Criminal Division granted him an imprisonment of 10 years.

So this shows that even the judiciary responds harshly to the offender in such cases.

In another U.K. case, Regina v. P.F ., the victim was the offender’s daughter. The victim’s mother was deaf and when the victim was 12. Her mother effectively ended sexual relations with the offender following a road accident and health problems. The offender therefore turned his attentions to the victim. The victim was described by her mother as being very much under her father's control, she lacked confidence, was easily led and easily bullied. The offender was very controlling of her. The sexual abuse began when the victim was 12. This lasted for four years when she was 16. From the age of 16, the offender started to have intercourse with her on a regular basis. He told her that if she told anyone, they would both get into trouble and go to jail. This sexual abuse continued till she attained the age of 26, when she disclosed the abuse to a colleague. The offender was arrested in 2006 and the court sentenced him to eleven years and three months imprisonment. He appealed against the order of the court in Court of Appeal Criminal Division but the appeal was dismissed.

In another case of U.K., Regina v. Barry S , there were three victims, 2 were offender’s daughters and 1 was his granddaughter. In relation to his elder daughter, he sexually abused her when she was 9 years old till she attained the age of 26 and with regard to his younger daughter, he sexually abused her when she was 11 years old, till she attained the age of 19. And in relation to his granddaughter, who was his eldest daughter’s daughter, he sexually abused her when she was 8 till she attained the age of 14 years. The eldest daughter disclosed the offences only when her own daughter had come forward. The matter came to light when the granddaughter disclosed that her grandfather had been touching her to a member of staff at school. The trial court sentenced him to a total of 15 years imprisonment. The appellant appealed against this order in Court of Appeal Criminal Division and his imprisonment was reduced from 15 to 12 years. 

In another recent U.K. case, Regina v. Deborah Mugridge , the offender was the mother of the 2 victims Y (girl) and C (boy). In May 2000 the offender beat her children with a stick, as a result of which they went to live with their maternal grandmother. In August, Y told her grandmother that the offender had subjected her and C to sexual abuse. They were abused for a period of 2 years, when Y was aged 11 and C was aged 4 years. The offender was arrested in August 2000 but was released on bail and she fled to Gran-Canaria and it was only in 2006 that she was arrested by Spanish authorities on an international warrant and returned to U.K. The trial court sentenced her to a custodial term of ten years and eight months and an extension period of three years. The offender appealed before the Court of Appeal Criminal Division and her sentence was reduced to custodial term of nine years and an extension period of three years.

In another case of U.K., R v. O (Philip Brian) , the offender was the father of the victim. He sexually abused her between 1968 and 1976 when she was 5 years old till she attained the age of 13 years and caused her to develop psychological and physical problems. And it was only in 2002 i.e. after 26 years that the girl reported the matter. The trial court sentenced him to an imprisonment of 12 years. He appealed against the order of the court in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division and his sentence was reduced to 8 years. 

In an important recent case of U.S.A, People v. Scott , the offender was the father of the victim, Jane Doe. In 2004, she turned 18 and her birthday was celebrated at her sister’s house where her father was also present. Doe was raised by another relative and so she saw her father only occasionally during her childhood. After the party, offender asked Doe to accompany her to his house, as his girlfriend, Smith with whom he had lived for 15 years will not let him in the house unless Doe was with him so she went with him. At offender’s house, Smith smelled alcohol on the offender and Doe and saw a drink in offender’s hand, so she asked him to stop drinking and went to sleep in the living room with her 4 year old daughter. The offender and Doe went to his bedroom to get some socks for Doe. Since Doe was planning to spend the night there so she lied on the bed fully clothed. After sometime, even the offender got into bed and started sexually abusing her and had intercourse with her. Doe was crying and scared of the defendant but she did not say anything. Immediately afterward, she got out of bed and tried to leave the house and walked back to her sister’s house. She was crying and upset when she arrived but did not tell anyone what had happened. So her sister called the police. Doe hesitated to tell them but eventually she told everything. She was taken to a hospital where a medical examination was conducted and the findings were that she had nonconsensual intercourse few hours before. 

The trial court sentenced him to 6 years in prison, consisting of aggravated term of 3 years doubled to 6 years based on prior strike conviction. He appealed before the superior court on the ground that his conviction violates his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights because the statute criminalizes sexual intercourse between consenting adults and relied on the case of Lawrence v. Texas . The court held that Lawrence dealt only with sodomy between consenting adults of the same sex. It did not deal with other matters pertaining to sex, including consensual incest between adult members of the opposite sex who are related by consanguinity. Also the court held that, like other states, California has a legitimate interest in maintaining the integrity of the family unit, in protecting persons who may not be in a position to freely consent to sexual relationships with family members, and in guarding against inbreeding. The court rejected his Appeal and affirmed the trial court’s decision.
In another famous case of U.S.A., in Cincinnati, the victim was the step-daughter of the offender, Lowe, a former sheriff’s deputy. The case originated in 2003 when the stepdaughter told the police that she had been raped by Mr. Lowe. Because the woman made the accusation well after the sex occurred and to save her the trauma of cross-examination, prosecutors chose not to charge Mr. Lowe with rape, but only with sexual battery based on the incest law.
The case is complicated by the county prosecutor’s contention that the sex between Mr. Lowe and his stepdaughter was not consensual. 
He pleaded no contest to a sexual battery charge in 2004 for having intercourse with his stepdaughter, who was 22. He was sentenced to 120 days in jail, three years of community control and 250 hours of community service and was designated a sexual offender.
The conviction was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court in a 6-to-1 decision on Feb. 28. It ruled that Mr. Lowe had no constitutional right to have sex with his stepdaughter and that the Ohio law unambiguously barred sex regardless of the stepchild’s age. The court ruled that “The state has a legitimate interest in prohibiting incestuous relations and in protecting the family unit and family relationships. The law makes no exception for consent of the stepchild or the stepchild’s age.” 
So this shows that in many foreign countries there are proper laws to deal with this offence of incest and the courts apply these laws appropriately to punish the offenders of such a heinous crime. 
A comparison of the Indian and foreign judgements on the issue shows that in India the punishments are not accorded properly and the major reason for this is that we don’t even have a provision for this offence like in other countries.

In India, the judiciary’s reaction to this issue is mixed. Though they’ve awarded punishments in a few cases but that is only under rape laws, if rape is proved. So even they’ve not made the position clear. Even they are reluctant to speak on the issue of incest, and the researcher thinks that this is because, may be even they are waiting for the Legislature to take a step forward in this regard. And due to the absence of any provision to deal with incest, in many cases the accused is acquitted because his offence though being a shameless crime cannot be brought under any category of the offences under our criminal justice system, so we need a provision to deal with this offence, so that the accused could be punished properly.
INCEST: A SOCIAL ISSUE
Incest, being a major social issue, lets have a look how our society looks at it and what are its impact on the incest victims, their condition, their approach and what has been done by the society and our law for such people. 
For the purpose of empirical study, the researcher interviewed incest victims and even got a questionnaire filled up from them which has been annexed herewith and marked as Annexure 1. The researcher even conducted an empirical study on the general public and even got a questionnaire filled up from them which has been annexed herewith and marked as Annexure 2. 
With regard to incest victims:
The researcher interviewed incest victims and even got a questionnaire filled up from them. This provided researcher with the actual insight as to what all difficulties these victims have to go through because of lacunae in our law. The researcher came to know that this is one of the major reason why such cases are hardly reported because the victims know that even if they stand up against the abuse, they’ll have no one to support them, no family, no police, no social support system will come to their rescue and so they continue to suffer in silence.
The researcher interviewed 10 incest victims in Mumbai. And it was only after meeting these victims that the researcher got to know that incest victims are hardly believed by anybody in our society with regards to their abuse. They are the most helpless people on this earth, because forget about the world outside, they don’t even have their family to support them. And in many cases forget about believing them, they are called as people of bad character with no moral values and so they suffer those charges as well as the psychological trauma caused to them by the abuse. And to add on this, they don’t even have any law to their backing.
On the basis of the questionnaires that the researcher got filled up from the incest victims the following results were revealed and have been represented here in form of a pie diagram:

•	Sex of the victim.


 

Out of them 2 were males and 8 were females. And this even shows that in case of incest generally the victims are females only.  


•	Have you faced incest?


 

All of the victims were abused at some or the other point of time of their life by their own family members or close relatives.


•	What was your relation with the abuser?


 

6 of them were sexually abused by their own family member (father, grandfather, brother-in-law, father-in-law) and 4 of them were abused by distant relatives (uncle, aunt).


•	Did you report it to the police?


 
Only 3 of them reported the matter to the police. And the other 7 didn’t report the matter because of family pressure and also they said that they know that even reporting would not help them in any way as the police won’t do anything. 

•	Did you experience any psychological trauma due to the abuse?


 

There was not even a single victim whose psyche was not affected by the abuse. Infact few of them suffered such severe psychological problems that it took them a very long time to recover from it. 


•	Did you go for any medical treatment to come out of the trauma?


 
Only 3 of them who reported the matter undergo medical treatment to come out of the trauma. The other 7 said that they didn’t go because they were scared and even guilty to tell about this to anyone.


•	What was your age when it happened?

 


5 of them were below the age of 12 years when the abuse occurred. 3 were in the age group of 12 -18 years when it happened. And 2 were in the age group of 18-30 years when the abuse occurred. And none of them were above 30 years. And when the researcher interviewed them, 6 of them were at that time between the age of 20 – 30 years and 4 were above 30 years.


•	Do you feel there is any need for any special law or a provision which specifically deals with this issue?


 

All of the victims asserted that we need a law on this issue badly, so that people like them atleast have something to back on. The victims said that there is also a need for some social support system, because victims of such cases are reluctant to go and report the matter to the police. If we have some proper support system atleast these victims can go to them and report the matter and they can help the victim with his/her further legal battle. 

So we need a law as well as a proper social support system to curb this social evil from our society.


•	If we have a special law on incest, what according to you should be included in it?


 
All of the victims said that the offender should be punished harshly for the physical and psychological trauma caused to the victim by him/her. Also the offender must be made to pay fine which must be given to the victim. So all of them were of the view that both punishment to the offender and compensation to the victim are required for such an offence.
So, the results show that the victims are suffering in silence without reporting the matter to anyone. Even they are of the view that a law on this issue will help a lot in curbing this evil from the society and help such victims.
On the basis of the above mentioned data and the interviews conducted, the researcher has compiled a few common views of the incest victims –

1. That in cases of incest, generally it involves females who are being abused by their    
    own family members.
2. One of the major reasons why these cases are not reported is the attitude of the family    
    members as well as the police towards such victims which stops them to report their   
    matter. The family pressurizes the victim not to report to protect family honour. And     
    even if reported the police hardly does anything to help the victim. 
3. Hardly any victim of incest go for any medical help because of fear, shame. So we       
    need a social support system so that atleast these victims can go to them and they can  
    further take care of his/her medical treatments as well. 
4. It generally happens when the victim is between the age of 12-18 years.
5. There is a dire need for a proper provision to deal with this issue. Also there should be 
   a proper social support system to deal with such a heinous crime. 
6. If we have a provision for incest, it should provide stringent punishments to the offender and should also provide compensation to the victim.   


With regard to general public:
The researcher even interviewed general public to know their viewpoint on the issue and even got a questionnaire filled up from them. And from the interviews the researcher realized that how difficult it is in a society like ours to explain people about any such issue. 
The researcher interviewed and got a questionnaire filled up from 60 people few from Mumbai and few from Delhi. And the researcher interviewed people from lower, middle as well as upper class.
On the basis of the questionnaires that the researcher got filled up from the general public the following results were revealed and have been represented here in form of a pie diagram:

•	Do you know about incest as an offence?


 

Out of the 60 people, only 27 knew what incest actually meant. And in them also, few associated it only to marriage, few only to sexual relations and there were very few who actually knew the correct definition. So this shows the amount of ignorance in our society. So its high time we need to make people aware on the issue.


•	Is there any incident of incest that happened in your family or you came across any such incident around you?


 


Out of the 60 people, 7 of them came across an incident of incest in their family or their close relations.


•	If yes, what was the relation?


 


Out of the 7 people, who came across an incident of incest, 3 of them said that it was in very close relations and 4 of them said that it was in distant relations.
•	According to you is there any difference between incest and rape?

 




On this question 24 of them said that there is a difference between incest and rape. Few of them said that this difference is with regard to the relation i.e., in case of incest it involves familial relationships while in case of rape it can be strangers also. Few said that the difference is with regards to sexual intercourse, as in case of incest it is not necessary that there should be sexual intercourse while in case of rape, sexual intercourse is an essential element as required by Section. 375. 3 of them said that there is no difference between incest and rape. And 33 of them were not clear about as to the difference.


•	According to you, how supportive are police or other legal bodies in such matters?








Only 10 of them said that the police or legal bodies are supportive. 42 of them said that they are not supportive. Even they become one of the reason for victim’s humiliation.


•	If any such incident happen in your family or to you will you file a complaint? 


 

Only 26 of them said that they would file a complaint. 34 of them said that they won’t file any complaint, because they know how the police will react to such a case and they would not like to suffer further humiliation. And also few of them said that when we don’t have any law on the issue, then why should they go through so much of trouble (legal battle) and humiliation, and at the end see the accused being acquitted or maximum given an imprisonment for a small period. And for some of them, the reason for not reporting was shame, fear, guilt.


•	Should there be a separate law on incest?


 

To researcher’s astonishment, 54 of them said that we need a law to deal with this issue. Many of them even suggested that an addition to the current rape laws will even help. They were of the view that this is a very serious problem growing in our society and we need a provision in our criminal justice system which define and punish incest and even provide compensation to the victims of such a heinous crime.


•	What will you do if you come to know about any such incident around you?


 

Only 18 of them said that they would go to the police and complaint. 31 of them said that they would go to some NGO which deal with such an issue and tell them about the matter and ask them to take action. And 11 of them said that they would not do anything as it is someone else’s family matter so they won’t interfere.  
So, this shows though this offence is prevalent in our society but still the cases are not reported. Infact the people think that reporting would not help them in any way and will only add to the humiliation faced by them.

On the basis of the above mentioned data and the interviews conducted, the researcher has compiled a few common views of the general public –

1. That many people don’t even know what incest actually mean. So its high time we   
    need to make people aware on this issue.
2. Many people don’t even know the basic difference between incest and rape. 
3. The common viewpoint on the issue that whether police is supportive in such matters 
    is that they are not at all supportive and that’s the major reason why victims in such 
   cases does not report the matter.
4. That there is a need for a separate provision to deal with this issue.
5. Many people if come across any such case, would prefer going to a NGO and reporting 
    rather than going to police.

So this shows that a provision dealing with incest is the need of the hour in our country. Also we need a social support system to support the victims. So both these are required to curb this social evil from our society.











 
 
CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS

Incest is one the world’s greatest, and most painful secrets. Often victims of incest feel that they cannot share their dark secret with anyone which may be because of shame, guilt, threat from the perpetrator or social and familial pressure. As a result, this heinous crime continues behind the locked doors and the victim continues to suffer. 

Incest has become an unspoken cultural tradition in many families. No one asks for it. No one discusses it. No one complains about it. It is just being carried out quietly behind the four walls of a sacred institution, called family. Being so much prevalent in our society, it still remains the most under-reported and least discussed crimes.

Incest means sexual relationship within prohibited degrees of relationship but where a male partner enters into a sexual liaison with a female without her consent, it is taken as rape and the remedy is provided under I.P.C. However, in India, the legal provisions do not differentiate between a sexual abuse by parents or relatives and by a stranger. And the fact is that such kind of sexual abuse which is committed by the most trusted people, parents or relatives, highly damage the psyche of the victim. Therefore, such cases of incest must be dealt with more sternly and quite differently. And if we talk about incestuous sexual behaviour between two consenting adults, then our I.P.C. is totally unknown to it, as if it doesn’t exist, as if it is not against our social norms and most importantly our society.

Incest occurs in families of every description and across all socio economic groupings. Incest takes place in families that are financially privileged, as well as those of low socio--economic status. It happens to those of all racial and ethnic descent, and to those of all religious traditions. The victims of incest are boys and girls, infants and adolescents. Incest occurs between fathers and daughters, fathers and sons, brother and sister and so on. The perpetrators of incest can be aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, nephews, stepnephews, step-parents, stepparents, step-children, grandparents and grandchildren. 

The biggest problem with this issue is that the social stigma attached to it makes the victim reluctant to come up and report the cases. And even if reported, they are not dealt with properly by the authorities. The researcher agrees that most of the cases of incest go unreported, but lack of laws makes the situation even more worse.

Incestuous behavior, however it is defined, has been and will continue to be a crime in almost every society. Sexual acts between parents and children, between the young and adults or older family members, will continue to offend and outrage those with the authority to set criminal standards and punish those who transgress them. Some will define the acts as abuse or exploitation of the young, others will use the terminology of deviance, or mental abnormality. Some will continue to see Incest as a question of morality; and others will see Incest as an example of the subjugation of women and young girls by men. 

After analysing the laws of different countries as compared to Indian laws on the issue of incest, it can be said that our laws are inadequate to deal with such an offence. I.P.C. provides for rape and it was considered sufficient to include the rare incidents of incest i.e. sexual relationship between prohibited degrees. The reason may be that when our I.P.C. was drafted the prevailing social conditions in our society were such that people never thought of such an offence, even though it was there at that time also but not so rampant, but today when our society is losing its moral values, this offence is also increasing at a higher rate. And therefore, there is a need for a separate and detailed provision containing definition, defences and punishment for this offence. 

In various other countries like U.K., U.S.A, Germany, Scotland, Australia, etc., their criminal justice system or their Constitution provides for provisions dealing with incest. In these countries incest is considered as a very serious crime and stringent punishments are given for the same. 
In various countries, the laws regarding incest may vary depending upon the prohibited degrees and the customs prevalent in that country, whatever may be the provision, the purpose for having a provision punishing incest is to protect the most sacred institution of our society - family from being destroyed by such shameful acts.

This offence requires harsher punishment because it is a crime against humanity, against our society. It destroys the whole social fabric of the family and the sacred family relations are shattered. And since very few cases are reported, so the cases reported must be investigated properly and the accused must be punished severely, so that it may deter others from committing such a shameful act.

Incest is a very serious problem in our society, though it doesn’t look like because the cases are not reported but it exists in large scale. Often, the victims of incest suffer serious emotional, physical, sexual and social problems, which can persist throughout the victim's life. Because the consequences of incest are so devastating, society has a strong interest in ensuring that incest victims are compensated for their injuries by harshly punishing the perpetrator.

It is high time we realize that we have a very serious incest problem in our country. It is only being allowed to continue because we have given it permission to do so. Because of our silence, many victims of it are being damaged emotionally and physically. Many infants born from incestuous relationships are developmentally emotionally and/or physically disabled. This places an added strain on the family system and the public health system. So, we very badly need a provision in our criminal justice system to punish this shameful crime.   

The researcher has tried to draft a comprehensive Provision for incest taking help of the Wisconsin (U.S.A.) law on incest as provided in the case of Allen v. Frank , which if enacted can help a lot in curbing this social evil from our society. A provision for incest can be incorporated as Section 375A termed as Incest which provides as:
“Whoever marries or has nonmarital sexual relationship whether consensual or non-consensual with a person he or she knows is a blood relative and such relative is in fact related in a degree within which the marriage of the parties is prohibited by the law of the state is guilty of incest.
When it is consensual, both the parties shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may be for ten years.
When it is non-consensual, the perpetrator shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may be for life and shall also be liable to fine.” 

Our criminal justice system needs such a provision very badly to save our society from the menace of such a heinous crime which is against our morals, our societal norms, our ethics. 

Also there is a need for a Social Support System which can be managed by social welfare workers because then only can we expect the victims to come forward and report the abuse. Its only then, that the victims will be sure that there is someone definite, they can turn to for help. And also they’ll be assured that there’s someone from whom they can hope for a sympathetic response and who’ll help them through each phase of their ordeal. 

In U.S.A., we have RAINN (Rape Abuse and Incest National Network) which came into existence in 1994, is a nonprofit corporation which helps the victim of sexual assault and even educates the public about sexual assault prevention. It even operates a National Sexual Assault Hotline to help the victims. It even has 1100 local rape crisis centers attached to it. And according to the Crime Records Bureau of U.S.A., due to the efforts of RAINN and its affiliated rape crisis centers, sexual violence in America has fallen by more than half since 1994 .
In India also we need some organization like this, may be not on such a large scale, but atleast we need to begin with it.  An organization where incest victims can atleast go and expect help. A place where they know they can share such a problematic issue of their life and will even get support in their legal battle. 
Also in Israel we have Israel Association for Child Protection (ELI) and National Council for Protection of Child, which helps incest victims report the crime by easing their way through the justice system, from their first visit to the police station to their testimony in court. ELI even has a clinic where children who are removed from their families are kept and counseled.
So like in U.S.A. and Israel, even in India we can have a social support system like this. And to begin with, we can associate few NGOs together and make one organization to deal with victims of sexual offences only which may be called “National Organization for Victims of Sexual Offences” (NOVSO). And this organization would only deal with victims of sexual offences like rape, incest, and other kinds of sexual abuse. And for starting, the government should fund all its activities, because once we start with it, even private funds would come in slowly. This organization would help the victim throughout its legal battle and also provide counseling to the victim and would also have a rehabilitation center to provide shelter to victims if they feel that the victim would not be safe in his home till the case goes on. 

With such an organization atleast we can expect that the victims will come forward and report their cases because they’ll be sure that there is someone who’ll listen to their problem, help them and even get the offender punished. 

So, if we have such a provision and such a social support system in India, we can expect victims of such crimes to start reporting the matters because they’ll know that now they have a legal backing and for all other help they’ll have the social support system. 

With this the researcher would like to conclude with a few more suggestions which if implemented in our criminal justice system, will surely help in eradicating this anti social act from our society.

The victims must be provided with medical and psychological treatment to come out from the trauma and after that she should be rehabilitated and for this social welfare workers and counselors must be appointed. And for rehabilitation, compensation should also be given to the victim and if the abuser due to his poverty is unable to compensate the victim, then it should be State’s responsibility to compensate the victim.

Also in many cases it is seen that even after the matter is reported and the investigation starts, the victim turns hostile because of family pressure. So where there are such chances, the victim must be kept in some rehabilitation centres atleast till the investigation goes on.
 
The most important measure is to reform the mind set of our society and this can be best done by T.V. and Press, by telecasting Social Awareness Programmes regarding the issue. We need to make people aware on the issue, as we can see it from the results of the empirical study conducted by the researcher that many people are unaware about the issue.  Also there is a need to educate children in schools on this issue so that they cannot be abused by anyone. 

So its time our society needs to realize that this offence needs a recognition badly, so that we can protect its victim, who can be a daughter, a son, a granddaughter, a grandson, a sister-in-law, a daughter-in-law, a nephew, a niece, the list is endless, from its own family members only.

We cannot allow such a heinous crime to happen in our society just because its happening and its being accepted by few people. We cannot give legal acceptance or even social acceptance to such an immoral act because if we allow such an act today more immoral acts will be asked to be allowed tomorrow. And if we are allowing such an act, then where are our morals, our values we abide by. So, we need to have a provision for this crime, because its wrong and we cannot allow it to continue in our society by punishing the wrong-doers harshly.

After analyzing the laws of different countries and the attitude of our Courts, the punishment provided for this offence appears very less for it. After seeing the growing menace of incestuous relations, the punishments should be harsher and a separate and detailed provision containing definition, defences and punishment should be added in the Penal Code.

The whole social fabric of the family is destroyed and the sacred family relations are shattered. The chances of getting married are shunned down rather the whole life of the victim is finished. As very few cases are reported, a case reported should be investigated properly and the accused must be prosecuted and punished severely because if any one is punished for such act or attempt then no one would dare to attempt to commit such a shameful act. And this can be possible only when we have a law, a provision to deal with such a shameful crime.

Therefore, its better to have a law addressing the prevalent problem in a society rather than leaving it unnoticed. The researcher finds that the existing legal framework is inadequate to deal with the issue of incest effectively.

So, its high time to criminalize incest as a distinct offence. Its time for the Legislature to give attention to this issue which has been neglected for all these years. It has never been looked upon by the Legislature but today when its so much prevalent in our society it cannot be ignored anymore. The Legislature may draw inspiration from the provision drafted by the researcher and the Sexual Offences Act 2003 of U.K and the proposal made by Law Commission in its 172nd Report while shaping the penal law of incest in India. So, a provision to deal with such an offence is the need of the hour.
